            <p>Thank you for your interest in Méthode Traditionnelle.</p>

            <p>By registering/digitally signing below and/or using the marks, you agree that you will only use these logos/marks for Méthode Traditionnelle (M.T.) and Méthode Traditionnelle - 3 Year (M.T. III) on beers created meeting the requirements listed below.</p>

            <p>If at any time a product stops meeting these requirements, you agree that use of the mark will be discontinued in association with that product.</p>

            <p>Further, you agree that the mark is only to be used on beer packaging, menus, or electronic descriptions of the beer. Any other commercial use of the mark (merchandise, glassware, etc) requires express written permission from The Méthode Traditionnelle Society.</p>

            <p><em>A note on The Méthode Traditionnelle Society:</em><br>
            The Méthode Traditionnelle Society currently consists of a 3 person steering committee. On October 16th, 2017, an email will be dispatched to those who have signed up to use the mark to gather nominations for the first board of the society.</p>

            <p>This board will put in place the by-laws of the society. These will include a more specific review process for commercial use (merchandise), a system for responding officially to clarification questions, and a timeline to consider suggestions/clarifications/changes to the standards, as well as terms and limits on board members.</p>

            <p>The founding steering committee felt that it was important to involve all interested parties in these decisions, and this seemed to be the best way to make sure those most interested in using the mark would have a chance to be involved.</p>

            <h2>Méthode Traditionnelle</h2>
