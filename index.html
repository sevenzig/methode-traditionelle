                <h1 class="post-title">BREAKING: MÃ©thode Traditionnelle Society RELAUNCHES with new 47-page application process and $500 annual membership fee!</h1>
                
                <p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT: The Phoenix Rises from the Ashes</strong></p>

                <p>Hey fellow spontaneous fermentation connoisseurs and turbid mash enthusiasts!</p>

                <p>After a brief 7-year hiatus (we were busy perfecting our barrel char specifications and arguing about the exact temperature range for coolship cooling), the <strong>MÃ©thode Traditionnelle Society</strong> is BACK and better than ever!</p>

                <h2>What's New in 2.0:</h2>

                <p><strong>Enhanced Gatekeeping Protocol</strong>: Our certification now requires a minimum of 73 specific production steps, including documentation of your local microclimate's barometric pressure during cooling</p>

                <p><strong>Premium Pricing Structure</strong>: $500 annual membership fee (peasants need not apply), plus $200 per beer evaluation, plus $1,000 for the sacred logo licensing rights</p>

                <p><strong>Exclusive Vocabulary Training</strong>: Learn to say "this lacks the terroir complexity of true Pajottenland expressions" with a straight face</p>

                <p><strong>Mandatory Pilgrimage</strong>: All applicants must spend 6 months volunteering at Cantillon while posting Instagram stories about "earning your stripes in the old country"</p>

                <div class="certification-tiers">
                    <h2>New Certification Tiers:</h2>

                    <p><strong>ðŸ¥‰ MT-Basic ($25,000 bond required)</strong>: For breweries that <em>think</em> they understand spontaneous fermentation</p>

                    <p><strong>ðŸ¥ˆ MT-Artisanal ($50,000 bond + firstborn child)</strong>: Includes complimentary condescending looks from Belgian lambic masters</p>

                    <p><strong>ðŸ¥‡ MT-Transcendent ($100,000 bond + soul)</strong>: You may now legally use the phrase "mÃ©thode ancestrale" while stroking your waxed mustache</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What This Means for YOU:</h2>

                <p>No more confusion about whether your $35 bottle of "American Wild Ale" is <em>actually</em> respecting 400 years of Belgian tradition! Now you'll KNOW it's legitimate because we said so and charged you enough money to prove it.</p>

                <p>Finally, consumers can distinguish between:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Genuine artisanal spontaneous ales (MT certified, obviously)</li>
                    <li>Fake artisanal spontaneous ales (those sellout breweries who "prioritize accessibility over authenticity")</li>
                    <li>Grocery store sour beers (we don't speak of these)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>FAQ:</h2>

                <p><strong>Q: Why did the original program fail?</strong><br>
                A: Clearly because breweries like TRVE and De Garde lacked the vision to appreciate true regulatory excellence. Also, consumers weren't sophisticated enough to understand our genius.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: How is this different from just calling it "American Wild Ale"?</strong><br>
                A: We have STANDARDS now. Plus legal fees. Lots of legal fees.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Won't this just make already expensive beer even more expensive?</strong><br>
                A: That's the point! If you can't afford $45 for a 375ml bottle, you probably don't have the refined palate necessary to appreciate the subtle notes of bureaucracy and artificial scarcity.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: What about breweries that make excellent spontaneous beer but don't want to participate?</strong><br>
                A: They clearly hate tradition and probably use Lallemand yeast when nobody's looking.</p>

                    <h2>Special Launch Offer:</h2>
                    <p>The first 10 applicants will receive a complimentary lecture on why American terroir will never compare to the Zenne Valley, delivered personally by a guy who once visited Brussels and won't shut up about it.</p>

                <div class="edit-note">
                    <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Some people are asking if this is satire. The fact that you can't tell is exactly why American craft beer needs more regulation and higher prices. SMH my head.</p>

                    <p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: Stop DMing me asking where to buy methodetraditionnelle.org domain. It's already been purchased by a cryptocurrency startup that makes NFTs of barrel-aged beer concepts.</p>

                    <p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: Yes, we know De Garde makes amazing spontaneous ales without any certification. That's exactly the problem we're trying to solve.</p>
